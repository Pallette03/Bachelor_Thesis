  <description>ASICS Hyper-Rocketgirlâ„¢ SP 5 - White/Malibu Blue/Black
Sleek and speedy in design, the 5th rendition of the sprint favorite features a combination of mesh and hotmelt TPU overlays in the rearfoot while maintaining it's supportive synthetic leather forefoot.  The thin rubber outsole is combined with a lightweight nylon spike plate and five-pin spike design for optimal traction.  If you've got a date with velocity, we have the perfect shoes.</description>
