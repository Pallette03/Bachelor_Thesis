2D-3D feature extraction
	-> 3D model with annotated local features compared with extracted features from 2d image

	--> not possible with symmetrical objects

template based
	-> take multiple synthetic images of objects in all possible rotations -> compare with image and find similaritys

	--> sensitive to lighting 

viewpoint detection model trained solely on synthetic data -> https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7410665

heatmap because dynamic amount of keypoints


distance to correct point is loss
