2D-3D feature extraction
	-> 3D model with annotated local features compared with extracted features from 2d image

	--> not possible with symmetrical objects

template based
	-> take multiple synthetic images of objects in all possible rotations -> compare with image and find similaritys

	--> sensitive to lighting

HDRI polyhaven

Object detector --> viewpoint estimation dataset (only objects)

Detector (detects any Lego piece and extracts BB) --> Classifier (Brick Type or false positive) --> Pose Estimator (Trained on single Images of the corresponding brick)
--> This approach is perfect for the Use of HDRI as well as not needing depthmaps
